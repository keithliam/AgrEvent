# AgrEvent
AgrEvent is a web app that uses HTML5, CSS3 ([MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com)), Node.js, MySQL, and jQuery; and aims to help farmers by presenting events related to farming—along with essential information—tailored according to their interests.

## Note
* This project was not intended to be finished as it is only a prototype to be used for presentation purposes.
* The login page and signup page are not functional and are only basic html & css files.
